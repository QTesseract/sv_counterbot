NAME
    CounterBot

SYNOPSIS
    Counts up votes in a quest on SufficientVelocity. Uses approval voting,
    so questers can vote for multiple plans.

SYNOPSIS
        $ ./perl_tallyho.pl --page http://forums.sufficientvelocity.../page-2  [--id 111] [--stop 212] [--gm bob,kim]

    This says "start with this URL and roll forward to the end of the
    thread. Ignore anything before post #111 and stop when you get to post
    #212. The GMs are users 'bob' and 'kim', so ignore their posts."

    Anything in [quote] tags will be ignored. Anything by someone listed as
    a GM will be ignored.

    NOTE: SV does not use, and will not respond to, URLs ending in 'page-1'.
    If you get an empty report back, the first thing to do is verify that
    the URL you used actually works.

DESCRIPTION
    Reads through from the specified page (or post) to the last page in the
    thread, compiles a list of all votes, and then spits out a report at the
    end summarizing who voted for what. A typical report might be:

        CounterBot (eaglejarl), version <N>

        [B]Plan name: [URL=https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5468116/]Arrival[/url][/B]
        Voters: @AZATHOTHoth, @Citrus, @FullNothingness, @godofbiscuit, @Jackercracks, @Kingspace, @Sigil, @tarrangar, @TempestK, @TheEyes, @Void Stalker
        Num votes:  11
    
        [B]Plan name: [URL=https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5469924/]Arrival + Wands[/url][/B]
        Voters: @Angle, @DonLyn, @FullNothingness, @HyperCatnip, @Jackercracks, @Radvic, @rangerscience, @RedV, @Solace
        Num votes:  9
    
        [B]Plan name: [URL=https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5469924/]Arrival + Wands + Survivors[/url][/B]
        Voters: @Angle, @Jack Stargazer, @Jackercracks, @rangerscience, @TheEyes
        Num votes:  5
    
        ...etc...

    The various plans are linked back to where they were defined and
    everyone who voted is given an alert so that they know the results are
    up and can confirm their votes if they like.[1]

    Note that this is *approval voting*. In the report above, @Jackercracks
    voted for three separate plans so he's listed on all those plans. That's
    a feature, not a bug.

USE ON OTHER SITES
    CounterBot will probably work on any other board written on the same
    codebase as SV -- SpaceBattles and Questionable Questing should be fine,
    although that hasn't been tested.

EDGE CASES AND NOTES
  Retconned votes cause improper linking in the report
    Once in a while you'll see this:

     - Al writes post #2
     - Bob writes post #3 with the "[X] Do FOO" voting plan
     - Al goes back and edits post #2 to contain a vote for "Do FOO".

    In this case the plan will be linked to post #2, since that was where
    CounterBot first saw the plan referenced.

    There's not much to do about this, so ask the players not to retcon
    their votes.

  Voting by username
    The other tallybots on SV support voting by username, like so:

    In post #2 Alice writes: "[x] Plan Take Back Our Library From The Bad
    Guys!"

    In post #7 Bob writes: "[x] Alice"

    Bob is saying "vote for the plan that Alice wrote". This works in
    first-past-the-post voting, where each person can only have one plan and
    each voter can only vote for one plan. With approval voting you can't
    vote by username because if the person went back and added another plan
    later you would suddenly be voting for that as well.

TODO
    - A config file should be established so that standard variables (e.g.
    GM names) don't need to be entered each time. Could replace CLI options
    entirely, although it's still good to have those for convenience.

    - Cache pages in a subfolder so that we don't need to retrieve them
    every time.
